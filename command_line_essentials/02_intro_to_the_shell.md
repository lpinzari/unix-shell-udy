# Intro to the Shell

The **Shell** is a **command-line interface** for **running programs** on your computer. For type commands at a prompt and the *shell** runs programs for you and shows you their output.

Developers use it a lot, because it's fast and flexible. Also the **the vast majority of web servers run on Linux**, and the *Shell* is a vital tool for:

- **Deployment** and
- **Remote administration** on Linux servers.

Now, compared to using a graphical environment, or GUI, when you use the *Shell*, you do have to remember a bunch of magic words and incantations. But in exchange, once you get some practice in, **you get to do things really quickly** without a lot of pointing and clicking.

It's kind of like programming, really. If you've used the Java Script console in your browser, or any programming language interpreter, well, the idea of the Shell's command is pretty much the same.

You type out instructions in a special language, and the system runs them. And it shows you the output underneath. Then you get another prompt and you can do it again.

The *JS* console is a command-line for your browser. But the *Shell* is **command line for your computer in general**, working with files and directories, running programs and interacting with other computers.

Now, the program that we use to interact with the *Shell* is called a **Terminal program**.

If you are on Mac or Linux, you've already got a good one of these. If you're on Windows though, we'll take a look at how to install a shell and terminal program that works the same as the ones on Mac and Linux.

**Windows** does have a built-in command shell. It's based on  the old **MS-DOS** command line rather than the Unix heritage.

For Web developers, a **Unix-style shell** is pretty much a professional standard, because so much of the Web runs on Linux servers.

- The first thing, we'll do in this course is to get you up and running in the Terminal.
- Then we'll take a quick tour of **Shell commands** for **navigating files and directories**.
- You'll learn commands for **downloading files** from the Web, **Viewing text files**, and **customizing the shell itself** to make it friendlier.

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize the importance of the Shell terminal for a Web Developer.
- Operate with a Shell terminal using multiple commands.
- Practice various commands to perform different operations like navigating directories, files organization, etc.

### Recomendation
The Shell commands can be installed or not on your computer if you are using Linux or Mac and you have issues running the commands check the documentation specifically for the Operating System.

- [Linux](https://ss64.com/bash/)
- [MACOS](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet)
