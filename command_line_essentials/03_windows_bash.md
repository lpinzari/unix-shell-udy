> Note: There is a new Linux compatibility system in Windows 10, called **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**. If you've heard of it, you may be wondering why we don't use that in this course. It's an experimental mini-Linux-OS that runs inside Windows, like a virtual machine. You can access your Windows files from inside it, but it's a little bit dangerous to share files between the Linux and Windows sides. In the future, WSL will probably become less experimental, **but for now we'll be using Git Bash instead for this course**.
